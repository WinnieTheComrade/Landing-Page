# landing-page
This is my first take on creating a landing page using both, HMTL and CSS. 
The pictures used where taken from pexels.com and unsplash.com and credit goes to:

Rafael Quaty (https://www.pexels.com/th-th/@rafael-pereira-37077235/) (All the other pictures.)

What I truly learned from this project is aligning images and text by using CSS Flexbox and presenting it in a way that looks good.
